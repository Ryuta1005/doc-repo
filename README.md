# doc-repo

doc-repo is a documentation management tool for browsing and editing repository Markdown files in a browser while keeping Git and Markdown as the source of truth.

> [!WARNING]
> `doc-repo` is currently in alpha. CLI arguments and generated file structure may change in future releases.

## Why doc-repo?

Spec-driven development and AI-assisted development make it increasingly common to keep specs, design notes, meeting notes, and operational docs as Markdown in a repository. As those documents grow across directories, they become harder for everyone on a team to use.

- Markdown files are scattered across multiple directories.
- It is hard to browse content across files without opening an editor.
- It is difficult for non-developers to find and update documents through VS Code or Git.

doc-repo reads Markdown files from the repository, keeps the directory structure visible, and presents them as a two-pane browser workspace (left tree / right content). Documents can be edited in the browser and saved back to the original Markdown files, so non-developers can work with repository docs in a familiar OneNote- or Confluence-like flow.

The core concept is not simply converting Markdown to HTML. doc-repo keeps Git and Markdown as the canonical source while making repository documents readable and editable by people across roles.

## Features

- Recursively discovers `.md` files in your repository
- Preserves directory structure in tree navigation
- Provides a browser-based document workspace for repository Markdown
- Saves browser edits back to the original Markdown files
- Supports local server mode (`doc-repo serve`)
- Watches Markdown files while `serve` is running
- Reloads the browser automatically via SSE when a Markdown change is detected

> [!IMPORTANT]
> As of task 020 policy, direct static-generation entry (`doc-repo [scopePath]`) is retired.
> The only supported entry point is `doc-repo serve`.

## Quick Start

Prerequisite:

- Node.js 20+

Run inside a repository:

```bash
npx doc-repo serve
```

If the package is published under an alpha tag, use:

```bash
npx doc-repo@alpha serve
```

Then open `http://localhost:4000` in your browser.

## CLI

```bash
doc-repo init
doc-repo serve [--port <number>]
```

| Argument / Option | Description                                                   | Default |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `init`            | Generate `doc-repo.config.json` template in current directory | -       |
| `serve`           | Start local server and watch for changes                      | -       |
| `--port`          | Port for `serve` (CLI > config > default)                     | `4000`  |

### Serve Responsibilities

- `doc-repo serve` orchestrates: server start → file watch start
- Watches `.md` files and dispatches browser reload via SSE on change, add, or unlink
- The HTTP server serves Viewer assets and workspace files on one origin
- On exit (Ctrl+C / SIGTERM), stops in order: watcher → SSE connections → HTTP server

### Target Root

- Target root: resolved from `doc-repo.config.json` if present; falls back to Git root, then current directory
- Collection target: all Markdown files under target root (filtered by `include`/`exclude`)

## Configuration File

For full configuration details and validation rules, see [docs/config.md](./docs/config.md).

Create `doc-repo.config.json` in your repository root to configure behavior:

```json
{
  "name": "Doc Repo",
  "rootDir": "./docs",
  "include": ["specs/**/*.md"],
  "exclude": ["drafts/**"],
  "port": 4000
}
```

| Field     | Type       | Default        | Description                                                        |
| --------- | ---------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `name`    | `string`   | `"Doc Repo"`   | Site name shown in the sidebar header                              |
| `rootDir` | `string`   | Git root / cwd | Root directory for Markdown collection (relative to config file)   |
| `include` | `string[]` | `["**/*.md"]`  | Glob patterns to include. `[]` is treated the same as omitted.     |
| `exclude` | `string[]` | `[]`           | Additional glob patterns to exclude (merged with default excludes) |
| `port`    | `number`   | `4000`         | Port for `serve` command (overridden by `--port` CLI option)       |

**Resolution order**: config file (`doc-repo.config.json`) → Git root → current directory.

**Default excludes** (always active): `node_modules/**`, `.git/**`, `.doc-repo/**`

**`exclude` takes precedence over `include`.**

## Output

doc-repo prepares runtime artifacts under `.doc-repo` for `serve` execution:

```text
.doc-repo/
├── index.html        # serve entry page
├── assets/
├── viewer/
└── ...
```

Generated artifacts are intended to be consumed through `doc-repo serve`.

Reliability behavior:

- Serves Viewer assets and API on the same origin/port
- Guards against path traversal when serving workspace files
- Returns structured JSON errors for API failures

### Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning                                   |
| ---- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `0`  | Success (including success with warnings) |
| `1`  | Failure                                   |

## Markdown Support (Current)

- Converter: `markdown-it`
- `html: false` (raw HTML in Markdown is disabled)
- `linkify: true`, `typographer: true`
- Some GFM extensions (task lists, Mermaid, code highlighting) are not yet supported
- Relative images are rewritten to workspace-relative asset paths and served via `serve`

## Edit and Save Workflow

- Click `編集` in the viewer to switch the current document to rich text edit mode
- Supported formatting in Story 010: body text, heading 1/2/3, bold, italic
- Save request is validated against root/include/exclude/path traversal and `.md` extension rules
- If unsupported markdown segments are detected, a warning dialog is shown before continuing save
- Save failures are categorized and shown with retry guidance:
  - `invalid-target` (not retryable)
  - `unwritable-target` (not retryable until environment is fixed)
  - `transient-io` (retryable)
- Unsaved edits are guarded on document switch, edit exit, and browser unload

## Security Notes

- Raw HTML is disabled, but generation is still intended for trusted repositories
- If you run doc-repo on unknown repositories, review output before sharing

## Git Policy for `.doc-repo`

Choose a policy based on your use case:

- Treat as temporary artifact: add `.doc-repo/` to `.gitignore`
- Treat as distributable artifact: committing generated files is also possible (output is replaced on each successful run)

## Development

For contributors:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
npm run dev -- serve
npm run build
```

Build and run compiled CLI:

```bash
node dist/cli/index.js
node dist/cli/index.js serve
```

## Markdown Features & Constraints

**Supported**:

- Relative images (e.g., `![alt](./docs/assets/image.png)`): rewritten to `/assets/...` and resolved from workspace files in `serve` mode

**Not yet supported (planned for future releases)**:

- Attachments in Markdown (PDF, CSV, ZIP, etc. referenced via normal links like `[link](./docs/assets/file.pdf)`)
